%    This code constitutes an important tool for obtaining the results in
%    the manuscript entitled "Fourier-Legendre cryo-EM to generate 
%    SARS-CoV-2 S protein volumetric object from 2D Legendre bases 
%    Interpolator", submitted to The JOSA (Journal of the Optical Society
%     of America) A .
%
%    Recalling that the ROI are built from 3D tomographic by cryo electron 
%    microscopy (cryo-EM) image data from the research work "In situ 
%    structural analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike reveals flexibility mediated
%    by three hinges" with DOI: 10.1126/science.abd5223 [28].
%
%    From such work, we selected several frames (video image captures from
%    the tomographic image) and for each frame we obtained the phase of the
%    observed spikes or Protein S from the SARS-CoV-2 cells, segmented by 
%    multiples ciclos de filtrado por Fourier transform Method. Subsequently,
%    we integrate the phase of the different Spikes frames de una misma 
%    SARS-CoV-2 VP (virak particle) in a 3D matrix, where we obtain the 3D 
%    volumetric object (3D solid) of the SARS-CoV-2 virion particle or VP.
